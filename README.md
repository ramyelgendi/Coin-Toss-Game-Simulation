# Coin Toss Game

This README file provides instructions on how to run the Coin Toss Game simulation project successfully. The project involves simulating a game using Python and analyzing the expected number of cycles until a player loses. The game is based on simple rules and uses the concept of a Markov Chain with first step analysis to derive the expected value.


## Prerequisites

Make sure that Jupyter notebook is installed

## Getting Started


Before running the Jupyter Notebook project, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Python (Version 3+)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Running the Project

1. Navigate to the project folder where you cloned the repository using the Jupyter Notebook interface.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook file named Game_Simulation_Project.ipynb.
3. Execute the code cells in the notebook sequentially.

## Simulation Setup

The notebook contains code that simulates the game thousands of times and records the outcomes. It uses a pseudo-random number generator to simulate die rolls and captures various game parameters such as player balances, pot balance, winner, and loser.

## Analyzing Results

After executing all the code cells, you will obtain statistical analysis and visualizations. The project calculates the average number of cycles required until a player loses the game and displays the distribution of cycles. Additionally, it explores the relationship between the first roll of the die and the number of cycles.
